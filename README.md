## :penguin: :snake: anime-meta :penguin: :snake:

A personal project for generating an anime database using MongoDB, this project solely exists as a learning experience
for apply OOP principles like DI, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism with an emphasis on type hints.

### Architecture

This project tries adopts techniques typically found in [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), thus all
network models used to fetch data from the sample api are only used internally in the **data** layer while application specific models (aka entities) can 
be found in the **domain** layer.

### Dependencies
- pymongo
- uplink
- dacite
- mongo-thingy
- requests_oauthlib
- dependency_injector
- PyYAML
- asyncio
- marshmallow
